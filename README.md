# SnakTris
Simple windows console game

There is a saying that every programmer shoud code a Snake or a Tetris game at least once. So why not both? Behold the SnakTris.

The goal is simple:
* As a snake, try to match your shape to one of the allowed bricks (in any rotation).
* Upon eating the food, you become a tetris brick.
* If your shape matches an allowed brick, you can control where you fall but can't rotate.
* If you create an illegal shape, you fall down instantly (which can be also used for your advantage sometimes).
* Once the snake hits a wall or a brick, the game is over.
